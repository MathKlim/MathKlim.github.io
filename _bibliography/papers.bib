  abstract  = {In this paper we assign, under reasonable hypothesis, to each pseudomanifold with isolated singularities a rational Poincaré duality space. These spaces are constructed with the formalism of intersections spaces defined by Markus Banagl and are indeed related to them in the even dimensional case.}
